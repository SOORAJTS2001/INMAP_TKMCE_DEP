If your SQLite database is hosted on Heroku, you can use the Heroku CLI to create a backup of the database.

To create a backup of your database, follow these steps:

Install the Heroku CLI if you haven't already. You can download it from the Heroku website: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli.

Log in to the Heroku CLI by running the following command in your terminal: heroku login.

Use the following command to create a backup of your database: heroku pg:backups:capture --app APP_NAME.

Replace APP_NAME with the name of your Heroku app.

This command will create a backup of your database and store it on Heroku's servers.

Download the backup file by running the following command: heroku pg:backups:download --app APP_NAME.

This will download the backup file to your local machine.

You can now use the downloaded backup file to restore the database if necessary. To restore the database, use the following command: heroku pg:backups:restore DATABASE_URL <BACKUP_FILE.

Replace DATABASE_URL with the URL of your Heroku database and <BACKUP_FILE> with the name of the backup file.

Note that the Heroku CLI provides many other commands for managing your database, such as heroku pg:info, heroku pg:psql, and heroku pg:reset. You can use these commands to view information about your database, connect to it using a SQL client, and reset it to a previous state.
